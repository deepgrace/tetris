## Run
     runlevel     :  Complexity of the pieces              ( Default 31 )
     previewlevel :  Number of the pieces to be previewed  ( Default 6  )
     speedlevel   :  Speed of the current piece's descent  ( Default 0  )
     width        :  Width of the view                     ( Default 25 )
     height       :  Height of the view                    ( Default 30 )

     Usage        :  ./tetris [ <runlevel> [ <previewlevel> [ <speedlevel> [ <width> [height] ] ] ] ] 
     Range        :  [ 0 <= runlevel <= 31 ] [ previewlevel >= 1 ] [ speedlevel <= 30 ] [ width >= 17 ] [ height >= 10 ]
     Notice       :  runlevel previewlevel speedlevel width height belong to integer
